# tree-sitter-asa
tree-sitter for [asa](https://github.com/menaruben/asa)

# notes
Make sure to copy the [queries](./queries/) where they belong.
[Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix), for instance, needs to have those queries
in `~/.config/helix/runtime/queries/asa/`. More info [here](https://docs.helix-editor.com/guides/index.html).

As of now, I only have a `highlights.scm` but with asa evolving I will make sure to keep this repo up to date. :)
